## What is RAG?
RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation
* Retrieval - Seeking relevant information from a source given a query. For example, getting relevant passages of Wikipedia text from a database given a question.
* Augmented - Using the relevant retrieved information to modify an input to a generative model (e.g. an LLM).
* Generation - Generating an output given an input. For example, in the case of an LLM, generating a passage of text given an input prompt.
